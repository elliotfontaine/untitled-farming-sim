Here, you should add Godot scenes, their attached scripts (GDScript files) and any asset that is only used by it. For exemple the player sprite should be in a directory with the player's Scene and script. The assets folder at root is only for reused assets.
We'll make a tree of directories (for exemple / crops / wheat|corn|...) that represent our tree of Classes (if Scenes inherits from others).
